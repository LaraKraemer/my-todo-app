# My web todo 

As part of my Python Bootcamp, I've developed a todo app with the Streamlit library. 

## How to work with this repository
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have the latest Python version
3. Open Project: `cd myproject`
4. Install venv: `python3 -m venv venv`
5. Run venv: `source venv/bin/activate`
6. Run Streamlit library: `pip install streamlit`
7. Validate installation: `streamlit hello`
8. If the above doesn't work use: `python -m streamlit hello`
9. Import library; `import streamlit as st`
10. Write your first line: `st.write("Hello world")`
11. Create requirements file: ` pip freeze > requirements.txt`
12. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
13. Run your app: `python -m streamlit run app.py` or `streamlit run app.py`
14. Write more code, write the tests, and have fun! ðŸŽ‰
